# No Brick Transitions

> By Electrk

Disables the ugly white flash when planting bricks, the fade when changing a brick's color, and the fade when setting whether a brick is rendering.

Because it deals with rendering code, this DLL is **client-side only**. It is **not possible** to make it server-side, so don't ask.

Uses [RedBlocklandLoader](https://gitlab.com/Eagle517/redblocklandloader) to work.
